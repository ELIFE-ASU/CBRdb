# Tests

This folder contains test files for the project. Each test file is designed to verify the functionality of different
components of the codebase. The tests are organized by feature or task, making it easier to locate and run specific
tests as needed.

To run the tests, you can use a testing framework such as pytest. Make sure to install any necessary dependencies before
executing the tests.
