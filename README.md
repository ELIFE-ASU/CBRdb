# CBRdb: A Curated Biochemical Reaction database for precise Biochemical Reaction Analysis

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/804095458.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14948472) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ELIFE-ASU/CBRdb/HEAD)

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

We present CBR-db, a curated biochemical database that integrates and refines data from KEGG and ATLAS databases to
support precise analyses of biochemical reaction data. This curation effort addresses key limitations, such as the
presence of malformed chemical representations, inaccurate stoichiometry, and ambiguous or incomplete reaction entries.
These key improvements in CBR-db could facilitate the accurate analysis of physicochemical and thermodynamic properties,
which are essential for modeling the evolution of chemical reactions in research areas ranging from prebiotic chemistry
to metabolic network expansion. Altogether, CBR-db features a high number of high-quality reactions and compounds. The
CBR-db is designed to be continuously updated, incorporating the latest releases from the KEGG and ATLAS databases.
Furthermore, it provides a framework so the network can be extended and further issues can be addressed.

To start everything locally, you can look at run_all.py, which will take you through the whole data pipeline. Otherwise,
you can run each part by itself.

For further information, see the preprint
on [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/67c28c046dde43c908f7aa37).

## üìã Features

- Integration of KEGG and ATLAS biochemical reaction databases.
- Curation of compounds and reactions.
- Thermodynamic properties.
- Reaction pruning based on reaction feasibility and similarity.

## üí° Getting Started

To get started with the data, you can download the compounds `CBRdb_C.csv` and reactions `CBRdb_R.csv` from the
repository.

To get started with deeper components of CBRdb, follow the installation instructions below. After installation, you can
start using the
CBRdb package in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

## üîß Installation

<details>
<summary>Using conda env</summary>
<br>

Using conda is the recommended way to install the required packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/CBRdb.git
```

Change into the CBRdb directory.

```
cd CBRdb
```

Create the conda environment.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the conda environment.

```
conda activate cbrdb
```

Install CBRdb.

```
pip install -e .
```

If you want to install manually, follow the instructions below.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manually</summary>
<br>

### Fresh environment

It is recommended that you start from a fresh environment to prevent issues.

```
conda create -n cbrdb_env python=3.13
```

Activate the new env.

```
conda activate cbrdb_env
```

Add the conda-forge channel.

```
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
```

Best to make them strict

```
conda config --set channel_priority true
```

Make sure to upgrade the conda env to force the channel priority.

```
conda update conda --all -y
```

### Install the requirements

```
conda install numpy sympy matplotlib networkx pandas rdkit chempy requests urllib3 chemparse ase pymatgen -y
```

### Optional extras

The main optional extra to install is ORCA and/or MACE. You will need these if you are interested in doing ab initio
chemistry calculations.
For ORCA, head to their downloads [page](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/dlext/?view=detail&df_id=251).
For MACE, you will need to make sure you have PyTorch. Head to
the [official PyTorch installation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) instructions page. An example might look
like:

```
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
```

Then, proceed to install MACE. When you first run MACE, downloading a model might take a while.

```
pip3 install mace-torch
```

MACE offers a massive speed-up on GPUs but can run on a CPU.
For more thermodynamic calculations, we use equilibrator-api.

```
conda install equilibrator-api
```

### CBR-db install

Then install CBRdb:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/ELIFE-ASU/CBRdb.git
```
