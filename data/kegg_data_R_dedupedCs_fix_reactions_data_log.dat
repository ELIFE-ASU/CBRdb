making "rns": DataFrame of reaction attributes
  * is_balanced: whether the reaction is balanced as written
  * to_rebalance: unbalanced reactions that lack missing data, starred compounds, or vars-as-coefficients
  * is_balanced_except_star: reactions for which "*" is the only imbalanced element
  * charge_R-L: charge (im)balance across the reaction (charge_R - charge_L). If positive, right needs (-) or left needs (+)
making "formula_sides": pd.Series listing sets of formulas for to-rebalance reactions above.
making "el_diff_groups": DataFrame assigning group numbers to reactions based on their element-count diff (R - L).
