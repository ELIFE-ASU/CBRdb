# Data processing

This directory contains intermediates and resources for processing raw data into a format suitable for analysis. The
data processing steps include cleaning, transforming, and aggregating the data.

Manual steps are introduced where necessary to ensure data quality and integrity, resulting in the '_manual' files. Each
processing step is documented in the paper to provide clarity on the actions taken.
